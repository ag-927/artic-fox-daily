            <p><b>Locate the closest state-licensed wildlife rehabilitation who works with the species:</b> Arctic Fox Daily is thrilled to have launched a new community resource in Upstate New York to help connect finders of injured or orphaned wildlife to licensed rehabbers via an emergency hotline, <b><a href="https://www.fingerlakeswildlifehotline.org/">Finger Lakes Wildlife Hotline</a>, reachable at 585-880-0168.</b></p>
            <br>
            <p>The <a href="https://ahnow.org/">Animal Help Now</a> website is also a GREAT resource for helping connect the public and rehabbers. This is an online database featuring rehabbers throughout the United States.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In the meantime, <b>if safely possible, keep the animal contained in a quiet, safe dark area with as little stimulation and human/pet traffic as possible and do not handle it.</b> I do not recommend attempting to feed wildlife you find until they get to a rehabber, as it may do more harm than good if the animal is not yet stabilized and hydrated.</p>

            <section class="animal_help_description">
            <p><b>Need placement for a captive-born fox, wolfdog, or other exotic pet or rescue?</b> Since these animals are born in captivity, this means that they must stay in captivity, as it is both illegal and immoral to release a captive-bred wild animal. Please feel free to send me a detailed email if you need assistance. Include the species, age, vet history (if any), temperament, any important details or quirks, and photos of the animal. Please note that depending on the species of animal and my capacity limitations, <b>I cannot guarantee that I can intake your animal.</b>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Note for Wolfdog/Wolf Hybrid Placement:</b> Like fox sanctuaries, many Wolfdog sanctuaries are always running at full capacity. For this reason, as cliché as it may sound, <b>I STRONGLY suggest making a post on the Wolfdog rehoming groups you can find on Facebook.</b> You'll have to request to join these groups (there are a couple) prior to posting. IF there is a facility or qualified home that is looking for a specific temperament, gender, content %, etc., I guarantee they will be keeping their eyes on these Facebook group postings. You will have to use your own discretion when it comes to vetting potential homes.</p>
