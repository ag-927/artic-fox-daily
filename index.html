                    <h2>About Us</h2>
                <div class="about-body">
                    <p>Hi everyone, my name's Kimberly. My family and I live in Upstate New York, which is where I run my home-based wildlife rescue. I've been volunteering my time working with and raising rescued wildlife and exotic pets since 2012. I possess both federal USDA and NYS DEC licenses, which allow me to legally work with these animals. In 2020, my rescue efforts had grown enough that I decided to take the leap to found a nonprofit, and that's when Arctic Fox Daily Wildlife Rescue Inc. was born.</p> 
                <br>        
                    <p>Rescuing these animals is time-consuming, many times heartbreaking, but most of all - it's incredibly rewarding! We're able to provide forever sanctuary to an animal who'd otherwise have been euthanized and open up an enclosure door and allowing a rehabilitated animal to take its place back in nature is so unique and special.</p>  
                <br>
                    <p><b>We are personally responsible for all costs associated with our rescue efforts, and receive no funding from the government.</b> We rely on donations, grants, gifts from our wish list, or money out of our own pockets. No contribution is ever too small - thank you for your support!</p>
